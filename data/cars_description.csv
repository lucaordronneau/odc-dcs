Summary: The McLaren F1 is a sports car designed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars, and powered by the BMW S70/2 V12 engine. The original concept was conceived by Gordon Murray, who successfully convinced Ron Dennis to back the project, and hired car designer Peter Stevens to design the exterior and interior of the car. On 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production car, reaching 240.1 mph (386.4 km/h), surpassing the modified Jaguar XJ220's 217.1 mph (349 km/h) record from 1993.
The car features numerous proprietary designs and technologies; it is lighter and has a more streamlined structure than many modern sports cars, despite having one seat more than most similar sports cars, with the driver's seat located in the centre (and slightly forward) of two passengers' seating positions, providing driver visibility superior to that of a conventional seating layout. It was conceived as an exercise in creating what its designers hoped would be considered the ultimate road car. Despite not having been designed as a track machine, a modified race car edition of the vehicle won several races, including the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it faced purpose-built prototype race cars. Production began in 1992 and ended in 1998. In all, 106 cars were manufactured, with some variations in the design.In 1994, the British car magazine Autocar stated in a road test regarding the F1, ""The McLaren F1 is the finest driving machine yet built for the public road."" They further stated, ""The F1 will be remembered as one of the great events in the history of the car, and it may possibly be the fastest production road car the world will ever see."" In 2005, Channel4 placed the car at number one on their list of the 100 greatest cars, calling it ""the greatest automotive achievement of all time"". In popular culture, the McLaren F1 has earned its spot as 'The greatest automobile ever created' and 'The Most Excellent Sports Car of All Time' amongst a wide variety of car enthusiasts and lovers. Notable past and present McLaren F1 owners include Lewis Hamilton, Elon Musk, Rowan Atkinson, Jay Leno, George Harrison, Ralph Lauren, Nick Mason, and the Sultan of Brunei.
In the April 2017 issue of Top Gear Magazine, the McLaren F1 was listed as one of the fastest naturally aspirated cars currently available in the world, and in the same league as more modern vehicles such as the Ferrari Enzo and Aston Martin One-77 despite being produced and engineered 10 years prior to the Ferrari Enzo and 17 years prior to the Aston Martin One-77.",McLaren F1,McLaren,74.0

AMG independently hires engineers and contracts with manufacturers to customize Mercedes-Benz AMG vehicles. The company has its headquarters in Affalterbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. DaimlerChrysler AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became the sole owner of AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG, which is in turn owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group.AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, higher performance, better handling, better stability and more carbon fibre than their regular Mercedes-Benz counterparts. AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz class. AMG has also made special variants of some Mitsubishi and Honda models.
AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g. ""E 63"" as opposed to ""E 350""). The numerals do not always indicate engine size, but are rather a tribute to earlier heritage cars, such as the 300 SEL 6.3 litre. For example, newer-model AMG V8s such as the E 63 actually have 4.0L V8s.

Summary: The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a range of executive cars manufactured by German automaker Mercedes-Benz in various engine and body configurations. Produced since 1953, the E-Class falls midrange in the Mercedes line-up, and has been marketed worldwide across five generations.
Before 1993, the E in Mercedes-Benz nomenclature was a suffix following a vehicle's model number which stood for Einspritzmotor (German for fuel injection engine). It began to appear in the early 1960s, when that feature began to be utilized broadly in the maker's product line, and not just in its upper-tier luxury and sporting models.  By the launch of the facelifted W124 in 1993 fuel injection was ubiquitous in Mercedes engines, and the E was adopted as a prefix (i.e., E 220). The model line is referred to officially as the E-Class (or E-Klasse). All generations of the E-Class have offered either rear-wheel drive or Mercedes' 4Matic four-wheel drive system.
The E-Class is Mercedes-Benz' best-selling model, with more than 13 million sold by 2015. The first E-Class series was originally available as four-door sedan, five-door station wagon, two-door coupe and two-door convertible. From 1997 to 2009, the equivalent coupe and convertible were sold under the Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class nameplate; which was based on the mechanical underpinnings of the smaller C-Class while borrowing the styling and some powertrains from the E-Class, a trend continued with the C207 E-Class coupe/convertible which was sold parallel to the W212 E-Class sedan/wagon. With the latest incarnation of the E-Class released for the 2017 model year, all body styles share the same W213 platform.Due to the E-Class's size and durability, it has filled many market segments, from personal cars to frequently serving as taxis in European countries, as well special-purpose vehicles (e.g., police or ambulance modifications) from the factory. In November 2020, the W213 E-Class was awarded the 2021 Motor Trend Car of the Year award, a first for Mercedes-Benz.",Mercedes-Benz E63S AMG Wagon,Mercedes-Benz,72.0

Summary: The Porsche 997 is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 sports car manufactured and sold by the German automobile manufacturer Porsche between 2004 (as Model Year 2005) and 2013. Production of the Carrera and Carrera S coupés began in early 2004, all-wheel drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S began to be delivered to customers in November 2005, the Turbo and GT3 derivatives went on sale in late 2006 and the GT2 in 2007. In addition to the coupé and cabriolet versions, Targa versions of the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S were also available, which carry on with the ""glass canopy"" roof design used since its first application on the 993 until the 991, which reverted to the classic targa top layout used on the early 911 Targas.
The 997 was an evolution of the preceding 996, with the most significant changes being interior and exterior styling, the most notable being the replacement of the ""fried egg"" headlamps used on the 996 with the classic ""bug eye"" units. Larger 18-inch wheels were fitted as standard, and other engineering changes include slightly increased power; however, the car is technically very similar to its predecessor albeit with many revisions. A new S version was offered, with additional power from a slightly larger engine, sports suspension, and sports exhaust.
During 2009, Porsche updated the 997 line-up including styling changes, a revised engine with direct injection and the introduction of the company's new ""PDK"" dual clutch transmission. As a result, the updated 997 models were faster, lighter and more fuel efficient than the outgoing versions, with improved handling. In the case of the 997 Turbo, a comprehensively re-tuned all wheel drive system with an optional ""torque vectoring"" system was also a part of the upgrades package; in an October 2009 preliminary review, Car and Driver magazine estimated that when equipped with the PDK transmission, the updated Turbo should be capable of accelerating from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in three seconds.
The 997 received mostly positive reviews from the worldwide motoring press; even British motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, a known detractor of Porsche cars, noted that the 997 will ""make love to your fingertips and stir your soul.""",Porsche 911 GT2RS,Porsche,71.0

Summary: Audi AG (German: [ˈaʊ̯di ʔaːˈɡeː] OW-dee) is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. As a subsidiary of its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.
The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch (1868–1951). Two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer) also contributed to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.
The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. Horch, meaning ""listen"", becomes audi in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, which is translated as ""Progress through Technology"". Audi, along with German brands BMW and Mercedes-Benz, is among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world.",Audi RSQ8,Audi,69.0

The car is powered by a bespoke 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 373 kW (507 PS; 500 hp), supplemented by three electric motors to bring the total power output to 427 kW (581 PS; 573 hp). Two of these electric motors are mounted on the front wheels and the remaining one powers the rear wheels, allowing torque vectoring for improved cornering performance, torque fill for improved acceleration, and instant torque for improved response. The NC1 NSX was among the first sports cars and the first car in its performance segment to use hybrid technology. The car received an updated version in 2019, with minor changes to the chassis and styling. For its final model year in 2022, a limited-production Type S model was introduced, with an increase in power to 449 kW (610 PS; 602 hp), various tweaks to the chassis and transmission, and aerodynamic and styling upgrades. A total of 2,908 cars were produced, including 350 Type S models.
The second-generation NSX has been used in motorsports, with a GT500 class Super GT model competing between 2014 and 2023 and a production-based GT3 racing version debuting in 2017. It also won multiple awards, including 2017 Performance Car of the Year by Road & Track magazine.",Acura NSX Type S,Acura,68.0

Summary: Rolls-Royce has used the Phantom name on full-sized luxury cars over the past century, and is the second,  longest-used automobile nameplate in the world after the Chevrolet Suburban. The Phantom is a low volume, hand-built limousine, which in earlier generations was custom built to the customers desires, and sometimes extravagant whims. As automobile manufacturing became more prolific, and vehicles from other manufacturers could be built in greater numbers and at reduced prices, the Phantom remained hand-built and production of individual models only began once the order was placed. The use of the name ""phantom"" is a long tradition of naming models after ""ghosts"". 
Earlier versions from Rolls-Royce consisted of the chassis and engine, then arrangements were made to customize the body and interior to whatever the buyer requested. The Phantom is popular with wealthy business people, royalty and celebrities who desire the best of everything, and want a car with exclusivity and elegance.
During the years 1931-1998 when Rolls-Royce also manufactured Bentley vehicles, the Phantom was exclusive to Rolls-Royce and the approach to opulent vehicles wasn't shared with Bentley. When Bentley was an independent automaker, they did produce on a limited basis the Bentley 8 Litre limousine. When Rolls-Royce assumed operations and ownership, the 8 Litre was discontinued. Bentley would not manufacture a limousine until 2002 when the Bentley State Limousine was presented to Elizabeth II.",Rolls-Royce Phantom,Rolls-Royce,68.0

Summary: The Honda NSX, marketed in North America as the Acura NSX, is a two-seater, mid-engined coupe sports car manufactured by Honda.
The origins of the NSX trace back to 1984, with the HP-X (Honda Pininfarina eXperimental) concept, which was a mid-engine 3.0 L V6 engine rear wheel drive sports car. Honda committed to the project, with the intention of meeting or exceeding the performance of the then V8 engine Ferrari range, while offering reliability and a lower price point. The concept thus evolved and had its name changed to NS-X, which stood for ""New"", ""Sportscar"" ""eXperimental"", although the production model was launched as the NSX.
Gordon Murray, the designer of the McLaren F1 supercar, stated that he used the NSX as the inspiration for the F1 after test driving many high performance cars and finding the NSX chassis performed the best. Murray stated that the design was ""monumental"" to sportscar design. He found that the car could easily have handled more power and attempted to convince Honda to develop a more powerful engine, but they declined. This resulted in Murray developing the F1 with a BMW engine, but he was so fond of the NSX that he bought one for personal use and drove it for 75,000 kilometres (47,000 mi).

It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline luxury coupe. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.
Nissan's intention of creating a world beating sports car, the GT-R brand was revived as part of the Nissan Revival Plan. Overall development began in 2000, following seven years of development and testing, including the introduction of two concept models in 2001 and 2005. The production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The GT-R is a brand-new car built on the PM platform, and featured innovative concepts and technologies, such as the VR38DETT engine, an active suspension system and the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system, making it the first ever rear mounted independent transaxle all-wheel-drive vehicle. It is one of the first production cars to feature launch control and a dual-clutch transmission as well. The overall body is made out of steel, aluminium and carbon-fibre. Including several acceleration and speed records, the car has also set record lap times at the Nürburgring. 
The GT-R is offered worldwide, unlike its predecessors which were sold in a limited number of markets. It received several facelifts and updates to be up to date with its competitors, and special variants were also offered during its prolonged production span. The car is used in motorsports, notably winning championships in the FIA GT1 World Championship, Super GT and GT3 racing. It is well received among enthusiasts and automotive publications as well, British motor magazine Top Gear named it as ""one of the most incredible cars ever built of any kind"", due its exceptional performance and practicality at an affordable price. Despite being one of the fastest production cars, it has won numerous notable accolades such as the World Performance Car of The Year among many others.

AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz class. AMG has also made special variants of some Mitsubishi and Honda models.
AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g. ""E 63"" as opposed to ""E 350""). The numerals do not always indicate engine size, but are rather a tribute to earlier heritage cars, such as the 300 SEL 6.3 litre. For example, newer-model AMG V8s such as the E 63 actually have 4.0L V8s.

Summary: The Lexus LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Hepburn: Rekusasu LS) is a full-size luxury sedan (F-segment in Europe) serving as the flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive. In the fourth generation, Lexus offered all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option, and only one length was offered.
As the first model developed by Lexus, the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994. The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460/LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as Toyota Celsior (Japanese: トヨタ・セルシオ, Hepburn: Toyota Serushio), was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year), the fourth generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h/LS 600h L sedans.
Development of the LS began in 1983 as the F1 project, the code name for a secret flagship sedan. At the time, Toyota's two existing flagship models were the Crown and Century models – both of which catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process at a cost of over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
Since the start of production, each generation of the Lexus LS has been manufactured in the Japanese city of Tahara, Aichi. The name ""LS"" stands for ""Luxury Sedan"", although some Lexus importers have preferred to define it as ""Luxury Saloon"". The name ""Celsior"" is taken from Latin word ""celsus"", meaning ""lofty"" or ""elevated"".",Lexus LS 500h,Lexus,64.0

Summary: The Mercedes–Benz M276 engine is a direct injected, gasoline automotive piston V6 engine.
The M276 engine is not related to the Chrysler Pentastar except for the 60 degree angle, despite that it was developed while Chrysler was still owned by Daimler AG. This can be seen in its 60 degree vee–angle, as opposed to the 90 degree angle of its M272 predecessor. The 60 degree vee–angle eliminates the need for a balance shaft, improving refinement while reducing mechanical complexity. None of the parts are shared at all.The M276 engine features an aluminum engine block with Nanoslide cylinder coating and dual overhead camshafts with independent variable valve timing on 12 intake and 12 exhaust valves and a new 2–stage timing chain arrangement. The M276 also includes direct injection with piezo–electrically controlled injectors for 2 to 3 sprays per intake stroke in normal operation, multi–spark ignition that creates up to 4 sparks per cycle, and the demand–controlled fuel pump, water pump, oil pump and alternator that reduce parasitic loads.
The first spray of fuel injection creates the base lean burn mixture in the intake cycle, while the later spray(s), up to 4 more times in combustion cycle in difficult conditions for a clean burn, control when and where the ignition starts and how the burn propagates in stratified charge fashion. In combination with a new smaller and more efficient Variable Valve Timing mechanism on all 4 camshafts, the precise combustion control allows a quicker and smoother re–start of the engine for the stop–start system.  This VVT can alter cam timing up to 40 crank degrees with a higher speed than before, and enables limiting the intake charge combined with a normal combustion stroke, thus making the operating process an Atkinson Cycle in partial throttle conditions for better fuel efficiency.  These features are also shared with Mercedes' M278 V8 engine, announced at the same time.Mercedes–Benz claims that the new engine, in conjunction with the demand–controlled ancillaries and the stop–start system, can produce up to a 24% improvement in fuel economy while increasing power and torque over the M272. This efficiency improvement led to the various models with this engine being labeled with Blue Efficiency moniker.
Retaining most of the above characteristics, turbocharged smaller displacement DELA 30 variant was introduced in 2013 for C400 (W205) and subsequently offered on other models without the name Blue Efficiency.
For 2014 CLS400, a turbocharged larger displacement variant named DELA 35 came out to the market with a lower boost of 0.7 bar (10 psi) compared to 1.8 bar (26 psi) of DELA30 resulting in the same power and torque ratings at a lower fuel consumption.In 2015, a higher boost and a slightly lower compression ratio (10.5:1) were used to create a DE30LA version for AMG models, and is used for many AMG and Mercedes–Benz vehicles since.",Mercedes-Benz CLS450,Mercedes-Benz,63.0

Summary: Rolls-Royce has used the Phantom name on full-sized luxury cars over the past century, and is the second,  longest-used automobile nameplate in the world after the Chevrolet Suburban. The Phantom is a low volume, hand-built limousine, which in earlier generations was custom built to the customers desires, and sometimes extravagant whims. As automobile manufacturing became more prolific, and vehicles from other manufacturers could be built in greater numbers and at reduced prices, the Phantom remained hand-built and production of individual models only began once the order was placed. The use of the name ""phantom"" is a long tradition of naming models after ""ghosts"". 
Earlier versions from Rolls-Royce consisted of the chassis and engine, then arrangements were made to customize the body and interior to whatever the buyer requested. The Phantom is popular with wealthy business people, royalty and celebrities who desire the best of everything, and want a car with exclusivity and elegance.
During the years 1931-1998 when Rolls-Royce also manufactured Bentley vehicles, the Phantom was exclusive to Rolls-Royce and the approach to opulent vehicles wasn't shared with Bentley. When Bentley was an independent automaker, they did produce on a limited basis the Bentley 8 Litre limousine. When Rolls-Royce assumed operations and ownership, the 8 Litre was discontinued. Bentley would not manufacture a limousine until 2002 when the Bentley State Limousine was presented to Elizabeth II.",Rolls-Royce Phantom,Rolls-Royce,62.0

Summary: The Jeep Wrangler is a series of compact and mid-size four-wheel drive off-road SUVs manufactured by Jeep since 1986, and currently in its fourth generation. The Wrangler JL, the most recent generation, was unveiled in late 2017 and is produced at Jeep's Toledo Complex.
The Wrangler is a direct progression from the World War II Jeep, through the CJ (Civilian Jeeps) produced by Willys, Kaiser-Jeep, and American Motors Corporation (AMC) from the mid-1940s through the 1980s. Although neither AMC nor Chrysler (after it purchased AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original military model — both the CJ Jeeps and the conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid axles and open top, have been called the Jeep model as central to Jeep's brand identity as the rear-engine 911 is to Porsche.Similar to the Willys MB and the CJ Jeeps before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and frame, rigid live axles both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield and can be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard open bodies with removable hard or soft tops. However, the Wrangler series was specifically redesigned to be safer and more comfortable on-road, to attract more daily drivers, by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain, and interior, compared to the CJ line. The suspension on all Wranglers included trackbars and anti-roll bars, and, from the 1997 TJ onwards, front and rear coil springs instead of the previous leaf springs.From 2004 on, the Wrangler has been complemented with long-wheelbase versions, called Wrangler Unlimited. 2004-2006 models were longer versions with 2 doors. In 2004 only automatic transmission-equipped “Unlimited” versions were sold. In 2005 both an automatic and manual 6-speed (NSG-370) were offered. Since 2007, the long-wheelbase Wranglers were four-door models, offering over 20 in (508 mm) more room. By mid-2017 the four-door models represented three-quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.",Jeep Wrangler 392,Jeep,62.0

Summary: The Nissan Skyline GT-R (Japanese: 日産・スカイラインGT-R, Hepburn: Nissan Sukairain GT-R) is a Japanese sports car based on the Nissan Skyline range. The first cars named ""Skyline GT-R"" were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and were successful in Japanese touring car racing events. This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973.
After a 16-year hiatus, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 (""R32"") Skyline GT-R. Group A specification versions of the R32 GT-R were used to win the Japanese Touring Car Championship for four years in a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, with Jim Richards using it to win the championship in 1991 and Mark Skaife doing the same in 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993. The technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication Wheels to nickname the GT-R ""Godzilla"" in its July 1989 edition. Wheels then carried the name through all the generations of Skyline GT-Rs, most notably the R34 GT-R, which they nicknamed ""Godzilla Returns"", and described as ""The best handling car we have ever driven"". In tests conducted by automotive publications, R34 GT-R have covered a quarter of a mile  (402 metres) in 12.2 seconds from a standing start time and accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.4 seconds.
The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance, showcasing many advanced technologies including the ATTESA E-TS All-wheel drive system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering. Today, the car is popular for import drag racing, circuit track, time attack and events hosted by tuning magazines. Production of the Skyline GT-R ended in August 2002. The car was replaced by the GT-R (R35), an all-new vehicle based on an enhanced version of the Skyline V36 platform. Although visibly different, the two vehicles share similar design features and are manufactured in the same factory.
The Skyline GT-R was never manufactured outside Japan, and the sole export markets were Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, in 1991, and the UK (in 1997, due to the Single Vehicle Approval scheme). They are also popular across the world as used Japanese imports.
Despite this, the Skyline GT-R has become an iconic sports car as a grey import vehicle in the Western world (mainly the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, Canada, and the United States). It has become notable through pop culture such as The Fast and the Furious, Initial D, Shakotan Boogie, Wangan Midnight, Need for Speed, Forza, Driving Emotion Type-S, Test Drive, and Gran Turismo.

Summary: The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury SUV produced by BMW. The X5 made its debut in 1999 as the E53 model. It was BMW's first SUV. At launch, it featured all-wheel drive and was available with either a manual or automatic gearbox. The second generation was launched in 2006, and was known internally as the E70. The E70 featured the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic gearbox. In 2009, the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model.BMW marketed the X5 officially as a ""Sports Activity Vehicle"" (SAV), rather than an SUV, to indicate its on-road handling capability despite its large dimensions. The X5 signaled a shift away from the utilisation of body-on-frame construction, in favour of more modern monocoque chassis construction. Although the Mercedes-Benz M-Class was introduced more than a year prior to the X5, the X5 was the first to utilise a monocoque chassis. The M-Class used body-on-frame construction until its second generation.The X5 is primarily manufactured in North America, at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg. Assembly operations also take place in Russia by Avtotor, along with operations in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The X5 is also modified for armoured security versions, at the BMW de México Toluca plant.The automaker's SAV series, which was started by the X5, has expanded with derivations of other number-series BMWs.

238,-0.234405,-0.17497173,"Page: Mercedes-Benz M276 engine
Summary: The Mercedes–Benz M276 engine is a direct injected, gasoline automotive piston V6 engine.
The M276 engine is not related to the Chrysler Pentastar except for the 60 degree angle, despite that it was developed while Chrysler was still owned by Daimler AG. This can be seen in its 60 degree vee–angle, as opposed to the 90 degree angle of its M272 predecessor. The 60 degree vee–angle eliminates the need for a balance shaft, improving refinement while reducing mechanical complexity. None of the parts are shared at all.The M276 engine features an aluminum engine block with Nanoslide cylinder coating and dual overhead camshafts with independent variable valve timing on 12 intake and 12 exhaust valves and a new 2–stage timing chain arrangement. The M276 also includes direct injection with piezo–electrically controlled injectors for 2 to 3 sprays per intake stroke in normal operation, multi–spark ignition that creates up to 4 sparks per cycle, and the demand–controlled fuel pump, water pump, oil pump and alternator that reduce parasitic loads.
The first spray of fuel injection creates the base lean burn mixture in the intake cycle, while the later spray(s), up to 4 more times in combustion cycle in difficult conditions for a clean burn, control when and where the ignition starts and how the burn propagates in stratified charge fashion. In combination with a new smaller and more efficient Variable Valve Timing mechanism on all 4 camshafts, the precise combustion control allows a quicker and smoother re–start of the engine for the stop–start system.  This VVT can alter cam timing up to 40 crank degrees with a higher speed than before, and enables limiting the intake charge combined with a normal combustion stroke, thus making the operating process an Atkinson Cycle in partial throttle conditions for better fuel efficiency.  These features are also shared with Mercedes' M278 V8 engine, announced at the same time.Mercedes–Benz claims that the new engine, in conjunction with the demand–controlled ancillaries and the stop–start system, can produce up to a 24% improvement in fuel economy while increasing power and torque over the M272. This efficiency improvement led to the various models with this engine being labeled with Blue Efficiency moniker.
Retaining most of the above characteristics, turbocharged smaller displacement DELA 30 variant was introduced in 2013 for C400 (W205) and subsequently offered on other models without the name Blue Efficiency.
For 2014 CLS400, a turbocharged larger displacement variant named DELA 35 came out to the market with a lower boost of 0.7 bar (10 psi) compared to 1.8 bar (26 psi) of DELA30 resulting in the same power and torque ratings at a lower fuel consumption.In 2015, a higher boost and a slightly lower compression ratio (10.5:1) were used to create a DE30LA version for AMG models, and is used for many AMG and Mercedes–Benz vehicles since.",Mercedes-Benz GLE450,Mercedes-Benz,61.0

Summary: The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the ""pony car"" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by ""long hood, short deck"" proportions.Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units were sold in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch. In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger (1970). It also competed with the Plymouth Barracuda, which was launched around the same time. The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupes worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the 1970s, it included more features and was marketed as a personal luxury car.
From 1965 until 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel-drive throughout its production. From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. From 1974 until 1978, the Mustang (denoted Mustang II) was a longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Pinto. From 1979 until 2004, the Mustang shared its Fox platform chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles (becoming the final one to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford has produced two generations of the Mustang, each using a distinct platform unique to the model line.
Through its production, multiple nameplates have been associated with the Ford Mustang series, including GT, Mach 1, Boss 302/429, Cobra (separate from Shelby Cobra), and Bullitt, along with ""5.0"" fender badging (denoting 4.9 L OHV or 5.0 L DOHC V8 engines).",Ford Mustang GT,Ford,61.0

Summary: The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name ""supra"" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning ""above"", ""to surpass"" or ""go beyond"".The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.
The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code ""A"". Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also discontinued.In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth-generation Supra in the United States. Production of the fourth-generation Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth-generation Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 BMW Z4, was introduced.",Toyota Supra,Toyota,60.0

Summary: The Porsche 996 is the internal designation for the 911 model manufactured by the German automaker Porsche from 1997 until 2006. It was replaced by the 997 in 2004, but the high performance Turbo S, GT2 and GT3 variants remained in production until 2006. The 996 had little in common with its predecessor, with the first all new chassis platform since the original 911 and a new water-cooled engine. Technically, it was a major change, a complete breakthrough from the original car other than the overall layout.
The 996's development was shared with the roadster-only Porsche Boxster (986) whose nameplate was making its debut as Porsche's entry-level offering. The 986 was released shortly before the 996 for sales. Commonalities between the 996 and 986 included the front suspension, various interior components, and the engine, all of which were enlarged for the 996. However, the multi-link rear suspension was derived from the preceding 993. This was done mainly to save development costs as Porsche was facing financial troubles at that time. This move resulted in cost savings of approximately 30% in the development of the car.At its debut, the 996 featured the most significant change from the classic 911 series: a water-cooled engine replacing the previously air-cooled engine. Progressively stringent emissions and noise regulations, environmental concerns, a higher expectation for refinement and the need for a high-performance 4 valve per cylinder engine made the switch necessary.

Summary: The Lexus GS (Japanese: レクサス・GS, Rekusasu GS) is an executive car (E-segment in Europe) sold by Lexus, the premium division of Toyota. The same car had been launched in 1991 as the Toyota Aristo in Japan. For non-Japanese markets, it was released as the Lexus GS in February 1993. It continued using the Toyota Aristo name for the Japanese market until January 2005.
Designed as a performance sedan competing in the mid-luxury class, the GS slots between the compact executive IS and large/flagship LS, and shared its chassis with one of Toyota's longest-running nameplates, the Toyota Crown premium sedans until 2011.
Four generations of the GS have been produced since 1993, each available with six-cylinder engines and rear-wheel drive. V8 engines were also offered in all generations, and all-wheel drive and hybrid versions debuted in 2005. Previously, all-wheel drive versions were already made available in the Japanese-market S140 series Aristo. The first two generations had a Japanese domestic market equivalent, the Toyota Aristo (aristo is Greek for ""the best""), which was sold from 1991 until the Lexus marque's domestic debut in 2005. Though largely identical in exterior and interior design, the GS and the Aristo differed in their engine and transmission combinations as well as equipment packages. The GS name stands for Grand Sedan. However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, Grand Sport.The first generation Lexus GS began sales in the United States, Europe and selected Asian markets in 1993. It was originally introduced with an inline-six engine and exterior bodywork designed by Italdesign Giugiaro. The second generation model premiered in 1997, using a new platform, in-house styling, and adding a V8 version for the first time outside Japan. The third generation GS, which premiered globally for the 2006 model year, was produced in V6, V8, and hybrid versions, the latter known as the GS 450h. The third generation models were the first GS sedans to be badged as such in the Japanese domestic market.
The fourth generation Lexus GS premiered in August 2011 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, where models introduced included the V6-powered GS 350, hybrid GS 450h, and performance-tuned F Sport variants. A lower-displacement V6 model, the GS 250, premiered at the Auto Guangzhou Exhibition in November 2011, targeted at Asian and European markets. In some markets such as North America and Asia, the GS shares the mid-size sedan category in the Lexus lineup with the front-wheel drive ES, serving as its rear-wheel-drive counterpart.The GS was replaced in Europe by the Lexus ES from December 2018. The seventh generation ES is the first to be sold in Europe, replacing the GS in spite of being a front-wheel drive car. It went on sale from September 2018 in Russia, Turkey and other CIS markets and from December 2018 in Western and Central Europe. Production ended in August 2020.",Lexus GS-F,Lexus,60.0

Summary: The Porsche 997 is the internal designation for the Porsche 911 sports car manufactured and sold by the German automobile manufacturer Porsche between 2004 (as Model Year 2005) and 2013. Production of the Carrera and Carrera S coupés began in early 2004, all-wheel drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S began to be delivered to customers in November 2005, the Turbo and GT3 derivatives went on sale in late 2006 and the GT2 in 2007. In addition to the coupé and cabriolet versions, Targa versions of the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S were also available, which carry on with the ""glass canopy"" roof design used since its first application on the 993 until the 991, which reverted to the classic targa top layout used on the early 911 Targas.
The 997 was an evolution of the preceding 996, with the most significant changes being interior and exterior styling, the most notable being the replacement of the ""fried egg"" headlamps used on the 996 with the classic ""bug eye"" units. Larger 18-inch wheels were fitted as standard, and other engineering changes include slightly increased power; however, the car is technically very similar to its predecessor albeit with many revisions. A new S version was offered, with additional power from a slightly larger engine, sports suspension, and sports exhaust.
During 2009, Porsche updated the 997 line-up including styling changes, a revised engine with direct injection and the introduction of the company's new ""PDK"" dual clutch transmission. As a result, the updated 997 models were faster, lighter and more fuel efficient than the outgoing versions, with improved handling. In the case of the 997 Turbo, a comprehensively re-tuned all wheel drive system with an optional ""torque vectoring"" system was also a part of the upgrades package; in an October 2009 preliminary review, Car and Driver magazine estimated that when equipped with the PDK transmission, the updated Turbo should be capable of accelerating from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in three seconds.
The 997 received mostly positive reviews from the worldwide motoring press; even British motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, a known detractor of Porsche cars, noted that the 997 will ""make love to your fingertips and stir your soul.""",Porsche 997 911 Speedster,Porsche,60.0

The first SUV model developed by the company, five generations of the Bronco were sold from the 1966 to 1996 model years. A sixth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2021 model year.  The nameplate has been used on other Ford SUVs, namely the 1984–1990 Bronco II compact SUV and the 2021 Bronco Sport compact crossover.
Originally developed as a compact off-road vehicle using its own chassis, the Bronco initially competed against the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout.  For 1978, Ford enlarged the Bronco, making it a short-wheelbase version of the F-Series pickup truck; the full-size Bronco competed against the Chevrolet K5 Blazer and Dodge Ramcharger.
Following a decline in demand for large two-door SUVs, Ford discontinued the Bronco after the 1996 model year, replacing it with the four-door Ford Expedition; followed by the larger Ford Excursion. After a 25-year hiatus, the sixth-generation Bronco is now offered as a mid-size two-door SUV for the first time. It is also offered as a full-size four-door SUV with a 16 in (41 cm) longer wheelbase. It competes directly with the Jeep Wrangler as both a two-door and a four-door (hardtop) convertible.

Summary: The Lincoln Continental is a series of mid-sized and full-sized luxury cars produced between 1939 and 2020 by Lincoln, a division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company.  The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford, who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European ""continental"" styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire.
In production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.
As part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car. Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956–1957 Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.
Along with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo downsizing (for the 1980 model year).
American production of the Continental and MKZ, its only two sedans, ended in 2020 thereby making Lincoln a crossover/SUV-only brand in the USA.

Summary: The Audi A4 is a line of luxury compact executive cars produced since 1994 by the German car manufacturer Audi, a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. The A4 has been built in five generations and is based on the Volkswagen Group B platform. The first generation A4 succeeded the Audi 80. The automaker's internal numbering treats the A4 as a continuation of the Audi 80 lineage, with the initial A4 designated as the B5-series, followed by the B6, B7, B8, and the B9. 
The B8 and B9 versions of the A4 are built on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform shared with several models and brands across the Volkswagen Group. The Audi A4 automobile layout consists of a front-engine design, with transaxle-type transmissions mounted at the rear of the engine. The cars are front-wheel drive, or on some models, ""quattro"" all-wheel drive. The A4 is available as a sedan and station wagon. Historically, the second (B6) and third generations (B7) of the A4 also included a convertible version. For the fourth generation (B8) and onwards, the convertible, along with a new coupé and 5-door liftback variant, was spun-off by Audi into a new nameplate called the Audi A5.",Audi Q7 3.0 T,Audi,58.0

Summary: Mercedes-AMG GmbH, commonly known as AMG (Aufrecht, Melcher, Großaspach), is the high-performance subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG. AMG independently hires engineers and contracts with manufacturers to customize Mercedes-Benz AMG vehicles. The company has its headquarters in Affalterbach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
AMG was originally an independent engineering firm specializing in performance improvements for Mercedes-Benz vehicles. DaimlerChrysler AG took a controlling interest in 1999, then became the sole owner of AMG in 2005. Mercedes-AMG GmbH is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz AG, which is in turn owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group.AMG models typically have more aggressive looks, higher performance, better handling, better stability and more carbon fibre than their regular Mercedes-Benz counterparts. AMG models are typically the most expensive and highest-performing variant of each Mercedes-Benz class. AMG has also made special variants of some Mitsubishi and Honda models.
AMG variants are usually badged with two numerals, as opposed to regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g. ""E 63"" as opposed to ""E 350""). The numerals do not always indicate engine size, but are rather a tribute to earlier heritage cars, such as the 300 SEL 6.3 litre. For example, newer-model AMG V8s such as the E 63 actually have 4.0L V8s.

Summary: The Lincoln Continental is a series of mid-sized and full-sized luxury cars produced between 1939 and 2020 by Lincoln, a division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company.  The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford, who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European ""continental"" styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire.
In production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.
As part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car. Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956–1957 Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.
Along with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo downsizing (for the 1980 model year).
American production of the Continental and MKZ, its only two sedans, ended in 2020 thereby making Lincoln a crossover/SUV-only brand in the USA.  After it was discontinued in Lincoln's home market, Ford indicated that it planned to move Continental production to China.",Lincoln Continental,Lincoln,58.0

Summary: The Jaguar XJ220 is a two-seat sports car produced by British luxury car manufacturer Jaguar from 1992 until 1994, in collaboration with the specialist automotive and race engineering company Tom Walkinshaw Racing. The XJ220 recorded a top speed of 212.3 mph (341.7 km/h) during testing by Jaguar at the Nardo test track in Italy. This made it the fastest production car from 1992 to 1993. According to Jaguar, an XJ220 prototype managed a Nürburgring lap time of 7:46.36 in 1991 which was faster than any production car lap time before it.The XJ220 was developed from a V12-engined 4-wheel drive concept car designed by an informal group of Jaguar employees working in their spare time. The group wished to create a modern version of the successful Jaguar 24 Hours of Le Mans racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s that could be entered into FIA Group B competitions. The XJ220 made use of engineering work undertaken for Jaguar's then current racing car family.The initial XJ220 concept car was unveiled to the public at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production. Approximately 1,500 deposits of £50,000 each were taken and deliveries were planned for 1992.Engineering and emissions requirements resulted in significant changes to the specification of the XJ220, most notably the replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a collapse in the demand of high performance cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992, making it one of the most expensive cars at that time.",Jaguar XJ220,Jaguar,57.0

Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outback –  considered to be one of the toughest operating environments in both temperature and terrain. In Japan, the Land Cruiser was once exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota Store.
Since 1990, the smaller variation of the Land Cruiser has been marketed as the Land Cruiser Prado. Described as a 'light-duty' version of the Land Cruiser by Toyota, it features a different design compared to the full-size model and, up until 2023, it remains the only comfort-oriented Land Cruiser available with a short-wheelbase 3-door version.
As of 2023, the full-size Land Cruiser was available in many markets. Exceptions include the United States (since 2021), Canada (since 1996), Malaysia (which receives the Lexus LX instead), Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Brazil, and most of Europe. In Europe, the only countries where the full-size Land Cruiser is officially sold are Gibraltar, Moldova, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.  The Land Cruiser is hugely popular in the Middle East, Russia, and Australia, and also in Africa where it is used by farmers, the construction industry, NGO's, UN and humanitarian organizations, by national armies (often the pickup version) as well as by irregular armed groups who turn them into 'technicals' by mounting machine guns in the rear. In August 2019, cumulative global sales of the Land Cruiser family surpassed 10 million units.",Toyota Land Cruiser,Toyota,57.0

Summary: The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name ""supra"" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning ""above"", ""to surpass"" or ""go beyond"".The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.
The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code ""A"". Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also discontinued.In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth-generation Supra in the United States. Production of the fourth-generation Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth-generation Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 BMW Z4, was introduced.",Toyota Supra Turbo,Toyota,57.0

Summary: The Ford Explorer is a range of SUVs manufactured by Ford Motor Company since the 1991 model year. As the first four-door SUV produced by Ford, the Explorer was introduced as a replacement for the two-door Bronco II. Within the current Ford SUV range in North America, the Explorer is slotted between the Ford Edge and Ford Expedition. As with the Ford Ranger, the Explorer derives its name from a trim package previously offered on the Ford F-Series pickup trucks.
The Explorer has been offered in multiple chassis and powertrain layouts. The first two generations were directly derived from the Ford Ranger, switching to a model-specific chassis for the third and fourth generations. The fifth generation was repackaged as a crossover SUV, adopting a variant of the Ford Taurus chassis architecture (developed and modified for SUV use).
Alongside the five-door Explorer wagon, a three-door Explorer wagon was offered from 1991 to 2003, officially referred to as the Explorer Sport after 1999, serving as the direct replacement of the Bronco II; the 2001–2010 Ford Explorer Sport Trac was a crew-cab pickup derived from the model line. For police use, the Ford Police Interceptor Utility has been derived from the fifth and sixth-generation Explorer to replace the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (and the later Taurus-based Police Interceptor Sedan). Through rebranding, Mazda, Mercury, and Lincoln have sold versions of the Explorer; Lincoln currently markets the sixth-generation model line as the Lincoln Aviator.
For the North American market, the first four generations of the Explorer were produced by Ford at its Louisville Assembly Plant (Louisville, Kentucky) and at its now-closed St. Louis Assembly Plant (Hazelwood, Missouri); the model line is currently produced at Chicago Assembly (Chicago, Illinois).

The origins of the NSX trace back to 1984, with the HP-X (Honda Pininfarina eXperimental) concept, which was a mid-engine 3.0 L V6 engine rear wheel drive sports car. Honda committed to the project, with the intention of meeting or exceeding the performance of the then V8 engine Ferrari range, while offering reliability and a lower price point.

Summary: The Mini Hatch, stylised as MINI Hatch (or MINI Hardtop in the U.S.), also sold as Mini Cooper, Mini One, or simply called the (BMW) Mini, are a family of retro-styled two-door supermini hatchback and convertible; and (from 2014) a longer, subcompact 4/5-door hatchback. They were introduced in early 2000 by German automaker BMW under the 'Mini' brand. The second generation was launched in 2006 and the third, adding a longer 4/5-door hatchback, in 2014. A two-door convertible version was added in 2004, followed by its second generation in 2008.
BMW unveiled their Mini hatch concept at the 1997 Frankfurt International Motor Show, when the Mini marque was still part of the Rover Group, owned by BMW. The styling of the concept-car, intended to replace the original Mini, was well received by the public and further developed. The new Mini (Hatch) was launched by BMW in 2001, one year after their sale of the Rover Group in March 2000, and the classic Mini's discontinuation that same year. It was the first model of what has grown to be a prolific Mini range.
Contrary to prior replacements, like the 1974 Innocenti Mini and the 1980 Austin Metro, which repackaged the Mini's mechanicals in modernistically styled, slightly larger bodies, BMW's 21st century Minis are the opposite: they have pronounced retro-styling, based on the British originals, but share no parts or technology with the former.
Though still considered very compact, the 2001 hatchback's 3.63 m (143 in) length was 58 cm (22.8 in), or 19%, greater than the 3.05 m (10.0 ft) long 1959 Mini. Also, at 3.98 m (157 in), the 2022 five-door hatch stands 68 cm (26.8 in), or some 21%, longer than the original 3.30 m (130 in) Mini estate versions.
BMW's Mini models are produced in Cowley, Oxfordshire, England, at Plant Oxford, and since July 2014 (3-door only), at VDL Nedcar (the former DAF/Volvo plant) in Born, Netherlands. The Mini convertible is, since 2015, only assembled in the Netherlands.",Mini Cooper JCW GP,Mini,56.0

Summary: The Range Rover is a 4x4, mid-size Off-road vehicle series produced from 1969 to 1996 – initially by the Rover (later Land Rover) division of British Leyland, and latterly by the Rover Group.
The first generation of vehicles produced under the Range Rover name, it was built as a two-door model for its first 11 years, until a four-door also became available in 1981. The Range Rover then successfully moved upmarket during the 1980s, and remarkably debuted in the U.S. as a 17-year old model at the 1987 Los Angeles Auto Show.Availability of the two-door version was restricted from 1984, but it remained in production for some markets until 1994, when the second generation was launched. From that moment, Land Rover rebranded the original model under the term Range Rover Classic, to distinguish it from its new P38A successor, when the two were briefly built alongside, and applied the name retrospectively to all first-generation Range Rovers.Although formally superseded by the second generation Range Rover, starting in 1994 – both the successor and the more affordable first and second series of the Land Rover Discovery were heavily based on the original Range Rover's chassis, drive-train and body-structure, which in essence lived on until the third generation Discovery arrived, and its mechanical blood-line ended with the replacement of the Mark 2 Discovery after 2004.

Although neither AMC nor Chrysler (after it purchased AMC in 1987) have claimed that the Wrangler was a direct descendant of the original military model — both the CJ Jeeps and the conceptually consistent Wrangler, with their solid axles and open top, have been called the Jeep model as central to Jeep's brand identity as the rear-engine 911 is to Porsche.Similar to the Willys MB and the CJ Jeeps before it, all Wrangler models continue to use a separate body and frame, rigid live axles both front and rear, a tapering nose design with flared fenders, a fold-flat windshield and can be driven without doors. Also, with few exceptions, they have part-time four-wheel drive systems, with the choice of high and low gearing, and standard open bodies with removable hard or soft tops. However, the Wrangler series was specifically redesigned to be safer and more comfortable on-road, to attract more daily drivers, by upgrading its suspension, drivetrain, and interior, compared to the CJ line. The suspension on all Wranglers included trackbars and anti-roll bars, and, from the 1997 TJ onwards, front and rear coil springs instead of the previous leaf springs.From 2004 on, the Wrangler has been complemented with long-wheelbase versions, called Wrangler Unlimited. 2004-2006 models were longer versions with 2 doors. In 2004 only automatic transmission-equipped “Unlimited” versions were sold. In 2005 both an automatic and manual 6-speed (NSG-370) were offered. Since 2007, the long-wheelbase Wranglers were four-door models, offering over 20 in (508 mm) more room. By mid-2017 the four-door models represented three-quarters of all new Wranglers on the market.",Jeep Wrangler Unlimited,Jeep,56.0

Summary: The Jaguar XJ (X350) is a full-size four-door luxury saloon car manufactured and marketed worldwide by Jaguar Cars for model years 2003–2009 as the third generation of the Jaguar XJ saloon, carrying the internal designation X350 and the internal designation X358 following its 2007 intermediate facelift. Both the X350 and X358 were available with a six-speed automatic transmission, a range of petrol and diesel engines (V6, V8, and supercharged V8), numerous trim levels, and short wheelbase (2003–2009) or long wheelbase (2005–2009) car body configurations. Extended-length models were the longest vehicles Jaguar had manufactured.The X350 was noted for its advanced electrical systems, self-leveling, adaptive air suspension, and full aluminium unibody chassis and bodywork, among the first for a mass-produced automobile. The bodyshell (body in white) was 40 per cent lighter and 50 percent stiffer than its predecessor, despite its increased overall size. Styling of the third generation was a conservative evolution of the previous XJ's styling, and its slatted grille recalled that of the original 1968 XJ Series I. Exterior styling was by principal designer Tom Owen, along with Sandy Boyes, under the design directorship of Geoff Lawson, who died midway through the project, and his successor Ian Callum. The XJ's interior was styled by Giles Taylor.Manufacturing took place at Jaguar's  Browns Lane plant in Coventry, and was the final Jaguar to be produced there before moving to the Castle Bromwich Assembly plant in Birmingham in July 2005. With an unpainted and highly polished example of its all-alloy body shell on display, the X350 debuted at the 2002 Paris Motor Show. The full X350/358 generation largely coincided with Jaguar's ownership by Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group until Tata Motors purchased Jaguar in 2008. Production ended in March 2009 after seven years, with a total production of 83,566. While it was generally well received and profitable, sales were less than Jaguar had expected. It was followed by the XJ X351.",Jaguar XJ Super V8,Jaguar,55.0

Summary: The Maserati Coupé and Spyder (Tipo M138) are a series of grand tourers produced by Italian automaker Maserati from 2001 to 2007. The two nameplates refer to the four-seater coupé and two-seater convertible models, respectively. The design of both models was based on the preceding 3200 GT, which was not sold in the US. Due to the confusing nature of the names ""Maserati Coupé"" and ""Maserati Spyder"" (which could refer to any coupé or convertible Maserati has made) the Coupé and Spyder are both commonly referred to as the 4200 GT, which is an evolution of the prior model name and a reference to the increase in engine displacement from 3.2 L (3,217 cc) to 4.2 L (4,244 cc).The Spyder was first unveiled to the public at the 2001 Frankfurt Auto Show with the Coupé's debut following shortly thereafter at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show. Sales in the United States began in March 2002 for the Spyder and in May for the Coupé. The introduction of the Spyder heralded Maserati's return to the North American market after an 11-year hiatus. Almost as soon as it was introduced, the Spyder was selected by Forbes as the Best GT for 2001.The Coupé and Spyder were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign, who also designed the Ghibli, mid-engined Bora, Quattroporte III and the 3200 GT as well. Interior design was commissioned to Enrico Fumia and was based heavily on the 3200 GT's interior, restyled in 1999. The cars were built at the Viale Ciro Menotti plant in Modena, Italy. In total, 13,423 cars were produced before being replaced by the GranTurismo.",Maserati Coupe (6-Speed),Maserati,55.0

Summary: The Lexus LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Hepburn: Rekusasu LS) is a full-size luxury sedan (F-segment in Europe) serving as the flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive. In the fourth generation, Lexus offered all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option, and only one length was offered.
As the first model developed by Lexus, the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994. The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460/LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as Toyota Celsior (Japanese: トヨタ・セルシオ, Hepburn: Toyota Serushio), was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year), the fourth generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h/LS 600h L sedans.
Development of the LS began in 1983 as the F1 project, the code name for a secret flagship sedan. At the time, Toyota's two existing flagship models were the Crown and Century models – both of which catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process at a cost of over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
Since the start of production, each generation of the Lexus LS has been manufactured in the Japanese city of Tahara, Aichi. The name ""LS"" stands for ""Luxury Sedan"", although some Lexus importers have preferred to define it as ""Luxury Saloon"". The name ""Celsior"" is taken from Latin word ""celsus"", meaning ""lofty"" or ""elevated"".",Lexus LS 600hL,Lexus,55.0

In Japan, it was marketed as the Toyota Hilux Surf (Japanese: トヨタ・ハイラックスサーフ, Hepburn: Toyota Hairakkususāfu) and was withdrawn from the market in 2009. The original 4Runner was a compact SUV and little more than a Toyota Hilux pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed, but the model has since undergone significant independent development into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV. All 4Runners have been built in Japan at Toyota's plant in Tahara, Aichi, or at the Hino Motors (a Toyota subsidiary) plant in Hamura.
The name ""4Runner"" was created by copywriter Robert Nathan with the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising company as a play on the term ""forerunner"". The agency held contests to invent new names for Toyota's forthcoming vehicles. According to Toyota, the ""4"" described the vehicle's 4-wheel drive system while ""Runner"" was a reference to its all-terrain capabilities and how it could ""run"" off road.For some markets, the Hilux Surf was replaced in 2005 by the similar Fortuner, which is based on the Hilux platform.
As of 2021, the 4Runner is marketed in the Bahamas, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela.

Summary: The Ferrari Testarossa (Type F110) is a 12-cylinder mid-engine sports car manufactured by Ferrari, which went into production in 1984 as the successor to the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer. The Pininfarina-designed car was originally produced from 1984 until 1991, with two model revisions following the end of Testarossa production called the 512 TR and F512 M, which were produced from 1992 until 1996. Including revised variations, almost 10,000 cars in total were produced, making it at the time one of the most mass-produced Ferrari models.The Testarossa is a two-door coupé that premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show. All versions of the Testarossa were available with a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine design (engine between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity in the middle of the car, which increases stability and improves the car's cornering ability, and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40% front: 60% rear.The original Testarossa was re-engineered for the 1992 model year and was introduced as the 512 TR (TR meaning TestaRossa), at the Los Angeles Auto Show, effectively as a completely new car, and an improved weight distribution of 41% front, 59% rear. Another new variant called the F512 M was introduced at the 1994 Paris Auto Show. The car dropped the TR initials and added the M which in Italian stood for modificata, or translated to modified, and was the final version of the Testarossa, which continued its predecessor's weight distribution improvement of 42% front, 58% rear. The F512 M was Ferrari's last vehicle that featured the flat-12 engine.
The Testarossa is a recognized cultural icon of the 1980s, and was popularized by media including the 1984 television series Miami Vice (from the 1986 season onward) and Sega's 1986 video game Out Run.",Ferrari Testarossa,Ferrari,53.0

It is powered by a naturally aspirated 2.4 L I4 engine, producing 177 hp (132 kW) and 166 lb⋅ft (225 N⋅m) of torque. The exterior styling of the production Solstice is similar to that of the 2002 Solstice concept that preceded it. Production of the Solstice was to be running before summer 2005, but delays at the Wilmington plant pushed volume production to the fourth quarter.  The new hardtop targa top 2009 model was announced in mid-2008.  The Solstice uses the GM Kappa platform, which also underpins the Saturn Sky, Opel GT, and Daewoo G2X. It was the brand's first two-seater since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued in 1988.  The Solstice was nominated for the North American Car of the Year award and Design of the Year award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) for 2006. It was a runaway hit for Pontiac, with 7,000 orders in the first 10 days of availability and 6,000 more orders before winter. Although first-year production was planned at 7,000, GM apologized to customers for delays and increased production, delivering 10,000 by March 1.

Summary: The Mercedes-Benz 500 E (W124.036) is a high-performance version of the W124 sold by Mercedes-Benz from 1990 to 1995. The 500 E was created in close cooperation with Porsche. With its engineering department being fully occupied with the development of the new S-Class, Mercedes-Benz commissioned Porsche in 1989 to redesign the W124 chassis to fit the 5.0L V8 used in the SL into it, along with the necessary changes on the suspension system and drive train. When the car was ready, it was found that its widened wings didn't fit through the W124 assembly line in Sindelfingen in three places. Hence Porsche was also commissioned to assemble the car. As a side-effect this arrangement provided workload for Porsche's plant, as the company was in crisis at the time, and its factory capacity was underutilized.During production Mercedes-Benz delivered parts to Porsche's ""Reutter-Bau"" plant in Zuffenhausen (an urban district of Stuttgart) where the 500 E chassis were hand-assembled. When finished the chassis were transported by truck to the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Sindelfingen to be painted. As soon as the paint was dry the varnished chassis were then shipped back to Porsche's ""Rössle-Bau"" in Zuffenhausen where the engine was put in and the car completed. For final inspection and delivery the vehicles again were transported to Sindelfingen. This process took a full 18 days per car.
Design began in 1989. Called '500 E' through to model year 1993, for model year 1994 it was face-lifted along with the rest of the range and renamed to 'E 500'. The chassis constructed by Porsche was also used to produce the 400 E (W124.034), that was technically identical to its big brother, save its 4.2L V8 also used in the S-Class and some other minor changes. The 400 E (later renamed 'E 420') was produced in Sindelfingen, since it lacked the widened wings and thus was perfectly understated as it looked like one of its lesser siblings.In Germany, the 500 E first came on sale in late 1990, making its first appearance in the Mercedes-Benz October 1, 1990 pricelist, with a retail price of DM134,520. By January 2, 1993, the price had risen to DM145,590, and would stay at it until the car went off the market in late 1994, it was last available in the August 1, 1994 pricelist. In the United States, the car first became available as a 1992 model with a retail price of $81,800 and was available until MY 1994.",Mercedes-Benz 500E,Mercedes-Benz,52.0

Summary: The Chevrolet Tahoe, and its badge engineered GMC Yukon counterpart, are full-size SUVs from General Motors, offered since 1994 and 1991, respectively. Since 1982, Chevrolet and GMC sold two different-sized SUVs under their 'Blazer' and 'Jimmy' nameplates, by introducing the smaller S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy for the 1983 model year, below the full-size Blazer and Jimmy models. This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the 'Yukon' in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer as their 'new Blazer', while renaming the full-size Blazer as the 'Tahoe'. The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States, and was originally used as a trim level on S-10 models. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada.
For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer four-door model, slotting in size between the two-door models and the longer wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans.
The Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.
The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon are part of General Motors' full-size SUV family and are differentiated from the similar Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C pillar. An upscale trim GMC Denali sub-model joined the Yukon lineup as the top-of-the-line trim for the 1999 model year; the Cadillac Escalade is a closely related upscale version sharing the same platform.

Production of the Century began in 1967, and the model received only minor changes until redesigns in 1997 and 2018.
The Century derived its name from the 100th birthday of Sakichi Toyoda (born 14 February 1867), the founder of Toyota Industries. It is often used by the Imperial House of Japan, the Prime Minister of Japan, senior Japanese government leaders, and high-level executive businessmen. The Century is comparable in purpose to the Austin Princess/Daimler DS420, Cadillac Series 70, Mercedes-Maybach, Chinese Hongqi, Rolls-Royce Phantom, and Russian ZIS/ZIL limousines.
The first-generation Century was available with only a V8 engine (the third post-war Japanese-built sedan so-equipped) at its introduction in 1967 until a full platform redesign in 1997. The second generation was only installed with a Toyota-designed and -built V12, an engine bespoke to the Century, until 2018, when the power-train reverted to a V8 with the addition of Toyota's hybrid technology.
While the Century is a premium, full-size luxury sedan, it is not available at Japanese Lexus dealerships; it can only be purchased at specifically identified Toyota Store locations. The gold phoenix logo used throughout is called the Hō'ō (鳳凰) or Fushichō (不死鳥) from Sinospheric mythology, representing the Imperial House of Japan, and the image can be found throughout Asia, such as the Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto.The exterior styling of the Century has, with some modifications, remained unchanged since its introduction, primarily due to its perception as denoting conservative success. Its appearance is iconic in Asian countries and is usually painted black. The closest Japanese competitor was the Nissan President, with a similar status reputation although, during the 1960s and 1970s, the high market positioning was also shared with the Mitsubishi Debonair. In the 1970s, two other Japanese competitors introduced large sedans — the Isuzu Statesman de Ville and the Mazda Roadpacer (both derived from General Motors-Australia products) — which were short-lived.

The cars were manufactured at Valmet Automotive in Finland.The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the Karma's combined city/highway fuel economy at 52 mpg‑US (4.5 L/100 km; 62 mpg‑imp) equivalent (MPG-e) in all-electric mode, and at 20 mpg‑US (12 L/100 km; 24 mpg‑imp) in gasoline-only mode. EPA's official all-electric range is 32 mi (51 km). Due to the very small cabin interior volume, the EPA rated the Fisker Karma as a subcompact car.The first deliveries took place in the U.S. in late July 2011, and deliveries to retail customers began in November 2011. Pricing in the U.S. started at US$102,000 for the base model (EcoStandard), US$110,000 for the intermediate EcoSport model and US$116,000 for the top model (the ""Animal Free"" EcoChic). Around 1,800 units were delivered in North America and Europe through December 2012.

Summary: Jeep is an American automobile marque, now owned by multi-national corporation Stellantis. Jeep has been part of Chrysler since 1987, when Chrysler acquired the Jeep brand, along with other assets, from its previous owner American Motors Corporation (AMC).
Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles—both crossovers and fully off-road worthy SUVs and models, including one pickup truck. Previously, Jeep's range included other pick-ups, as well as small vans, and a few roadsters. Some of Jeep's vehicles—such as the Grand Cherokee—reach into the luxury SUV segment, a market segment the 1963 Wagoneer is considered to have started. Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016, up from 500,000 in 2008, two-thirds of which in North America, and was Fiat-Chrysler's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017. In the U.S. alone, over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep-branded vehicles, and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company, it is estimated to be worth between $22 and $33.5 billion—slightly more than all of FCA (US). Christian Meunier is the current President of the Jeep brand worldwide.Prior to 1940 the term ""jeep"" had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles, but the World War II ""jeep"" that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4×4, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs. The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Armed Forces and the Allies during World War II, as well as the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart noted: ""The spartan, cramped, and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky, can-do determination."" It is the precursor of subsequent generations of military light utility vehicles such as the Humvee, and inspired the creation of civilian analogs such as the original Series I Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations.
The Jeep marque has been headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, ever since Willys–Overland launched production of the first CJ or Civilian Jeep branded models there in 1945. Its replacement, the conceptually consistent Jeep Wrangler series, has remained in production since 1986. With its solid axles and open top, the Wrangler has been called the Jeep model that is as central to the brand's identity as the 911 is to Porsche.At least two Jeep models (the CJ-5 and the SJ Wagoneer) enjoyed extraordinary three-decade production runs of a single body generation.
In lowercase, the term ""jeep"" continues to be used as a generic term for vehicles inspired by the Jeep that are suitable for use on rough terrain.
In Iceland, the word Jeppi (derived from Jeep) has been used since World War II and is still used for any type of SUV.",Jeep Wrangler 6x6,Jeep,48.0

Over its single generation, production reached just over 98,000.The XT was conceived in the United States for the US market, and debuted globally in the US. After sales began in February 1985 in the US, the XT Turbo 4WD's debuted in Europe at the March 1985 Geneva Motor Show, followed by its Japanese debut in June 1985.The XT was noted for its pronounced wedge shape, low coefficient of drag; aviation influences from the aircraft division of parent company Fuji Heavy Industry; and its host of features, either innovative or uncommon in the XT's class — including adjustable pneumatic suspension, digital dash, central locking system, op-art upholstery, fold down rear seat, pod- and center console-mounted HVAC controls, advanced trip computer, and instrument cluster that tilted with adjustment of the steering column. With available front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, depending on the model year, the XT offered three trim levels, DL, GL (non-turbo, front-drive only), and GL-10 Turbo.The Alcyone nameplate derives from Alcyone, the brightest star in the Pleiades star cluster, stylized in the Subaru logo.  The model was superseded by the Subaru Alcyone SVX in 1992.",Subaru Outback XT,Subaru,48.0

During the 1990s, while the four-door sedan superseded the two-door coupe entirely, forced-induction engines made their return, with superchargers replacing turbochargers.
For 1999, the Buick Regal inaugurated the sale of GM vehicles in the Chinese market, with the 1997 design lasting through 2008.  Following the 2004 model year, Buick retired the nameplate in North America, with the Regal replaced by the Buick LaCrosse.
For 2008, Opel introduced the Opel Insignia as its largest sedan, with Buick rebranding the model line as the Regal for the Chinese market.  For 2011, GM reintroduced the Regal to North America, rebranding the Insignia sedan for North America.  For 2018, Buick introduced the second-generation Opel Insignia, sourcing all production from Germany; alongside a first-ever liftback sedan, the Regal TourX was the first Buick station wagon in 22 years.

In Japan, it was marketed as the Toyota Hilux Surf (Japanese: トヨタ・ハイラックスサーフ, Hepburn: Toyota Hairakkususāfu) and was withdrawn from the market in 2009. The original 4Runner was a compact SUV and little more than a Toyota Hilux pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed, but the model has since undergone significant independent development into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV. All 4Runners have been built in Japan at Toyota's plant in Tahara, Aichi, or at the Hino Motors (a Toyota subsidiary) plant in Hamura.
The name ""4Runner"" was created by copywriter Robert Nathan with the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising company as a play on the term ""forerunner"". The agency held contests to invent new names for Toyota's forthcoming vehicles. According to Toyota, the ""4"" described the vehicle's 4-wheel drive system while ""Runner"" was a reference to its all-terrain capabilities and how it could ""run"" off road.For some markets, the Hilux Surf was replaced in 2005 by the similar Fortuner, which is based on the Hilux platform.
As of 2021, the 4Runner is marketed in the Bahamas, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela.
The 4Runner came in at number five in a 2019 study by iSeeCars.com ranking the longest-lasting vehicles in the US. The 4Runner had 3.9 percent of vehicles over 200,000 miles (320,000 km), according to the study.",Toyota 4Runner,Toyota,47.0

The Chevrolet Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Chevrolet Bel Air and the Chevrolet Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-sized model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan.

Summary: The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes colloquially called the G-Wagen (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen) is a four-wheel drive automobile manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.
The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature.

Only the Unimog surpasses it. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named ""little G""—though no definitive date was given for the launch.
The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020.The success of second-generation W463 led to the 500,000th unit milestone three years later on April 2023. The 500,000th model was a special one-off model with agave green paintwork, black front end, and amber turn signal indicators in tribute to the iconic 1979 press release photo of jumping W460 240 GD.",Mercedes-Benz G500 Cabriolet,Mercedes-Benz,47.0

Summary: The Honda Passport is a line of sport utility vehicles (SUV) from the Japanese automaker Honda. Originally, it was a badge engineered version of the Isuzu Rodeo, a mid-size SUV sold between 1993 and 2002. It was introduced in 1993 for the 1994 model year as Honda's first entry into the growing SUV market of the 1990s in the United States. The first and second generation Passport was manufactured by Subaru Isuzu Automotive in Lafayette, Indiana. Like various other Honda models, it re-used a name from their motorcycle division, the Honda C75 Passport. The other two name candidates were Elsinore and Odyssey, the latter would be re-used a year later on a minivan.The Passport was a part of a partnership between Isuzu and Honda in the 1990s, which saw an exchange of passenger vehicles from Honda to Isuzu, such as the Isuzu Oasis, and trucks from Isuzu to Honda, such as the Passport and Acura SLX. This arrangement was convenient for both companies, as Isuzu discontinued passenger car production in 1993 after a corporate restructuring, and Honda was in desperate need of an SUV, a segment that was growing in popularity in North America as well as Japan during the 1990s. The partnership ended in 2002 with the discontinuation of the Passport in favor of the Honda-engineered Pilot.
In November 2018, Honda announced that the Passport nameplate would return as a two-row mid-size crossover SUV slotted between the CR-V and Pilot.

Jeep marketed XJs as Sportwagons, precursor to the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV), before that term was used. The XJ is credited for spawning competitors, as other automakers noticed the design cannibalizing sales from regular cars, supplanting the role of the station wagon and transforming the vehicle type ""from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners,"" though GM had also launched road-biased, RWD and 4WD compact SUVs, the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy, one year earlier, initially available in 2-door form only.The 2007 book Jeep Off-Road called the XJ a ""significant link in the evolution of the 4x4.""

Summary: The Lexus LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Hepburn: Rekusasu LS) is a full-size luxury sedan (F-segment in Europe) serving as the flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive. In the fourth generation, Lexus offered all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option, and only one length was offered.
As the first model developed by Lexus, the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994. The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460/LS 460 L series in 2006. A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as Toyota Celsior (Japanese: トヨタ・セルシオ, Hepburn: Toyota Serushio), was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year), the fourth generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h/LS 600h L sedans.
Development of the LS began in 1983 as the F1 project, the code name for a secret flagship sedan. At the time, Toyota's two existing flagship models were the Crown and Century models – both of which catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process at a cost of over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.
Since the start of production, each generation of the Lexus LS has been manufactured in the Japanese city of Tahara, Aichi. The name ""LS"" stands for ""Luxury Sedan"", although some Lexus importers have preferred to define it as ""Luxury Saloon"". The name ""Celsior"" is taken from Latin word ""celsus"", meaning ""lofty"" or ""elevated"".",Lexus LS 400,Lexus,43.0

Summary: The Lincoln Town Car is a model line of full-size luxury sedans that was marketed by the Lincoln division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company. Deriving its name from a limousine body style, Lincoln marketed the Town Car from 1981 to 2011, with the nameplate previously serving as the flagship trim of the Lincoln Continental. Produced across three generations for thirty model years, the Town Car was marketed directly against luxury sedans from Cadillac and Chrysler.Marketed nearly exclusively as a four-door sedan (a two-door sedan was offered for 1981 only), many examples of the Town Car were used for fleet and livery (limousine) service. From 1983 to its 2011 discontinuation, the Town Car was the longest car produced by Ford worldwide, becoming the longest mass-production car sold in North America from 1997 to 2011. While not a direct successor of the Town Car, the Lincoln MKS would become the longest American sedan until 2016 (overtaken by the Cadillac CT6).
From 1980 until 2007, the Lincoln Town Car was assembled in Wixom, Michigan, (Wixom Assembly) alongside the Lincoln Continental, LS, and Mark VI, VII, and VIII. After that factory closed, Town Car production moved to Southwold, Ontario, (St. Thomas Assembly) alongside the similar Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis. That factory was closed in September 2011; the final Lincoln Town Car came off the assembly line on August 29, 2011.Within the Lincoln model line, the Town Car was not directly replaced; the nameplate was used from 2012 to 2019 to denote livery/limousine/hearse variants of the Lincoln MKT. For 2017, the revived Continental replaced the MKS, closely matching the Town Car in wheelbase and width.",Lincoln Town Car,Lincoln,42.0

Summary: The Pontiac Fiero is a rear mid-engine, light sports car manufactured and marketed by Pontiac for model years 1984–1988. 
Styled by George Milidrag and Hulki Aldikacti as an economical commuter car with modest performance aspirations, it was Pontiac's first two-seater since their 1926 to 1938 coupes, and the first rear mid-engine mass-produced car by any American manufacturer.
In addition to using 4- and 6-cylinder engines to help Pontiac meet America's 'CAFE' average fuel economy requirements, the Fiero's chassis and structure technology used non-load-bearing, composite body-panels, contributing to the car's light-weight and unique selling proposition. Pontiac engineers modified the design over its life to enhance its performance and reposition the two-seater closer to the implications of its sporty configuration.
The Fiero 2M4 (two-seat, mid-engine, four-cylinder) was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1984, and was the Official Pace Car of the Indianapolis 500 for 1984.
A total of 370,168 Fieros were manufactured over five years' production. After suffering criticisms related to its mild performance as well as reliability and safety issues, the Fiero was discontinued after annual sales fell steadily.",Pontiac Fiero GT,Pontiac,42.0

In production since the 1935 model year, the model line is currently in its twelfth generation; it is the longest-used automobile nameplate in the world.  Beginning life as one of the first metal-bodied station wagons, the Suburban is the progenitor of modern full-size SUVs, combining a station wagon body with the chassis and powertrain of a pickup truck.  Alongside its Advance Design, Task Force and C/K predecessors, the Silverado pickup trucks share chassis and mechanical commonality with the Suburban.  
Traditionally one of the most profitable vehicles sold by General Motors, the Suburban has been marketed by both Chevrolet and GMC for nearly its entire history; GMC has used several different nameplates for the model line, marketing the Suburban as the GMC Yukon XL since 2000.  Cadillac also rebrands the Suburban as the Cadillac Escalade ESV.  During the 1990s, the Holden brand marketed right-hand drive versions of the model line.  
The Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Central America, Chile, Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel) while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to the United States, Canada and Mexico) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).

Summary: The Chevrolet Tahoe, and its badge engineered GMC Yukon counterpart, are full-size SUVs from General Motors, offered since 1994 and 1991, respectively. Since 1982, Chevrolet and GMC sold two different-sized SUVs under their 'Blazer' and 'Jimmy' nameplates, by introducing the smaller S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy for the 1983 model year, below the full-size Blazer and Jimmy models. This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the 'Yukon' in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer as their 'new Blazer', while renaming the full-size Blazer as the 'Tahoe'. The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States, and was originally used as a trim level on S-10 models. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada.
For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer four-door model, slotting in size between the two-door models and the longer wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans.
The Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.
The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon are part of General Motors' full-size SUV family and are differentiated from the similar Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C pillar. An upscale trim GMC Denali sub-model joined the Yukon lineup as the top-of-the-line trim for the 1999 model year; the Cadillac Escalade is a closely related upscale version sharing the same platform. The Denali is available on both standard and XL versions.

From 2002 to 2004, a rebadged right-hand drive variant of the Vibe was exported as the Toyota Voltz to the Japanese domestic market. The Voltz did not sell well in Japan and was discontinued after two model years.
Production of the Vibe ended in 2009 with the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand and the closing of NUMMI under the General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization. Its twin, the Toyota Matrix, was in production for another three years for the American market and four years for the Canadian market, as the Matrix was manufactured by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Cambridge, Ontario and was unaffected by NUMMI closing down operation.",Pontiac Vibe GT,Pontiac,38.0

Summary: The Ford Bronco is a model line of SUVs manufactured and marketed by Ford. The first SUV model developed by the company, five generations of the Bronco were sold from the 1966 to 1996 model years. A sixth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2021 model year.  The nameplate has been used on other Ford SUVs, namely the 1984–1990 Bronco II compact SUV and the 2021 Bronco Sport compact crossover.
Originally developed as a compact off-road vehicle using its own chassis, the Bronco initially competed against the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout.  For 1978, Ford enlarged the Bronco, making it a short-wheelbase version of the F-Series pickup truck; the full-size Bronco competed against the Chevrolet K5 Blazer and Dodge Ramcharger.
Following a decline in demand for large two-door SUVs, Ford discontinued the Bronco after the 1996 model year, replacing it with the four-door Ford Expedition; followed by the larger Ford Excursion. After a 25-year hiatus, the sixth-generation Bronco is now offered as a mid-size two-door SUV for the first time. It is also offered as a full-size four-door SUV with a 16 in (41 cm) longer wheelbase. It competes directly with the Jeep Wrangler as both a two-door and a four-door (hardtop) convertible.
From 1965 to 1996, the Ford Bronco was manufactured by Ford at its Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where it also manufactures the sixth-generation version.",Ford Bronco,Ford,38.0

Summary: The Isuzu VehiCROSS (UGS250) is a compact SUV from Isuzu. Produced from 1997 through 2001 (Japanese market 1997–1999; US market 1999–2001), it shares many of its components with the Trooper, including both its 3.2 L and 3.5 L V6 engine that produces 215 bhp (160 kW; 218 PS) at 5400 rpm and 230 lb⋅ft (312 N⋅m) of torque at 3000 rpm. The vehicle also features the Torque on Demand (TOD) 4-wheel-drive system produced by BorgWarner. It is a small, sporty 2-door crossover vehicle with aggressive external styling, including short overhangs, an aggressive forward stance, titanium ""teeth"" in the grille, a black hood-insert, and black plastic cladding over the entire lower half of the vehicle. The US VehiCROSS came equipped with 16"" polished wheels in 1999 and 18"" chrome wheels during the remainder of production. The Japanese version came equipped with 16"" alloys with chrome center caps.
The VehiCROSS combined a computer-controlled AWD system for on-road driving and a low-gear 4WD system for off-road driving. The Japanese version offered a 2WD non TOD or 4WD TOD option. The US-only constant 4WD TOD, with 12 independent sensors for detecting wheel spin and capable of redirecting power to the wheels with the most traction, gives the VehiCROSS a high level of traction on wet and icy roads.  It also has a high level of performance for its height. While possessing on-road nimbleness, its body-on-frame truck construction, suspension and 4WD gearing make it very capable off-road.
Sales were intentionally limited, with only 5,958 vehicles being produced between 1997 and 2001; 1,805 were produced for the domestic Japanese market and the remaining 4,153 sold in the United States. It appears that Isuzu revisited a limited production approach they used in the mid-1960s with the dramatic 117 Coupe and the later Isuzu Piazza to produce an exclusive two door vehicle. Japanese sales were limited by the fact that the exterior width dimensions were not in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the engine displacement obligated Japanese drivers for higher levels of annual road tax. The vehicle had a base price of $28,900.",Isuzu VehiCROSS,Isuzu,38.0

Similar to the configuration of the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the Ford Expedition is sold in regular and extended lengths (the Ford Expedition EL/Max); sold since 2007, the latter functionally serves as the replacement for the Ford Excursion.
Since 1997, the Lincoln division has marketed the Ford Expedition as the Lincoln Navigator, the first full-size SUV sold by a luxury auto brand in North America (the Expedition was never sold as a Mercury). The third Ford vehicle to use the Expedition nameplate, the full-size SUV follows a 1992 F-150 Eddie Bauer concept vehicle and a 1995 trim level package on the two-door Ford Explorer Sport.
Prior to 2009, the Ford Expedition was assembled at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan (previously home to the Ford Bronco). After 2009, the Ford Expedition was moved to the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky.",Ford Explorer XLT,Ford,37.0

Summary: Trabant (German: [tʁaˈbant] ) is a series of small cars produced from 1957 until 1991 by former East German car manufacturer VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau. Four models were made: the Trabant 500, Trabant 600, Trabant 601, and the Trabant 1.1. The first model, the 500, was a relatively modern car when it was introduced.
It featured a duroplast body on a steel chassis, front-wheel drive, a transverse two-stroke engine, and independent suspension. Because this 1950s design remained largely unchanged until the introduction of the last model, the Trabant 1.1 in 1990, the Trabant became symbolic of the former East Germany's stagnant economy and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in general. Called ""a spark plug with a roof"", 3,096,999 Trabants were produced. Older models have been sought by collectors in the United States due to their low cost and fewer restrictions on the importation of antique cars. The Trabant also gained a following among car tuning and rallying enthusiasts.",Trabant Trabant,Trabant,27.0
